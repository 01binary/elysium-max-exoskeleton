# Elysium Max Exoskeleton
Replica with custom parts (not exactly as in the film but with more detail).

> All STL/OBJ exports use millimeter units.

* [Parts are viewable on GitHub](https://github.com/01binary/elysium-max-exoskeleton/blob/master/print/HipRight.stl).
* [Instructions for building](https://github.com/01binary/elysium-max-exoskeleton/raw/master/instructions/assembly%20instructions.pdf) are included.
* [Follow the project on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/19830-elysium-max-exoskeleton).
* [See the build log on Replica Prop Forum](http://www.therpf.com/showthread.php?t=212832).
* Interested in contributing? Fork or see the project tasks [here](https://github.com/01binary/elysium-max-exoskeleton/projects/1).
